[c/FF4500:EXTRA EXPLOSIVES]
We have decided that terraria doesnâ€™t have enough fun explosives, so we came up with a solution! We introduce to you Extra Explosives! Extra Explosives takes old boring bombs and makes them useful again(even in the late game). We are continuously updating and working on this mod, more explosives to come with some unique properties and explosions. Check us out on the homepage to voice your opinion and thoughts on bugs, balancing, and what other explosives you might like to see. 

Whats to come:
Nuke, Bomb Buddy, Meteorite Buster and more!!!
We are hoping to have 10+ explosives by V2.0
